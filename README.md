# CP216-Grading-Tool

Accepts zip file for students labs and other reference text files for grading criteria.

Just easier than managing the nested zips and folders and clears up clutter.
Still need to manage grading.txt manually.

Anything uploaded and current files are saved in local storage so you can come back to it later, files aren't sent anywhere though.
